This is my vimrc and vim
==========================

Things I used to think is that productivity is independent of the IDE
I'm ashamed after seen the power of the vim and I'm not an anti emacs
I love vim and developing or using small tricks to get my life to ease

like
nnoremap ; :
nnoremap : ;

any way just pull the .vimrc and try the twiks
:-)

And all the twiks are taken from net and accumulated !!
